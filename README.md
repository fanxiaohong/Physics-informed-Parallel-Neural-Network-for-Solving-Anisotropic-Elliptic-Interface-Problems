# Physics-informed-Parallel-Neural-Network-for-Solving-Anisotropic-Elliptic-Interface-Problems
Abstract: In this study, we propose a physics-informed parallel neural network for solving anisotropic elliptic interface problems, which can obtain accurate solutions both near and at the interface. We rewrite the original second-order system into a first-order system to reduce the regularity requirement of solutions by an auxiliary variable. We use different sub-networks to predict solutions in different subdomains and couple them together by loss function terms designed by the interface jump conditions. In addition, we use a piecewise loss function combining L1 norm and L2 norm to enhance the robustness of outliers. Numerical experiment verifies the accuracy and effectiveness of proposed method for solving anisotropic elliptic interface problems. Key Words: anisotropic, elliptic interface, neural network, first-order system
